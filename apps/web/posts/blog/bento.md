I made various dashboard apps for some protocols/wallets part-time and was soon disappointed that they were moving cringely outside their ecosystem.

It turns out that services are primarily associated with specific Layer-1 chains built by the same team or shared VCs. Users need multi-chain and scalability, but products were just too busy looking at other business things. The others are closed-source software, so development is centralized to the team. If you want your protocol listed, you have to depend on the team to add support.

That made me decide to build an open-source dashboard of my own. And after that, I began building, made the team, and named the app "Bento." You can check the page here: https://bento.finance
