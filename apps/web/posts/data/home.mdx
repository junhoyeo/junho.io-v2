## IBCX

**PM/FE 2022.10 ~**

Product Manager and Frontend Engineer of the development team.

The idea behind the Cosmos Ecosystem is that future blockchain will be
application-specific, not a single chain. Until now, people who believed in
it bought $ATOM, but it lacked direct representation of the potential of
numerous projects built as app-chains.

Powered and governed by the [ION DAO](https://ion.wtf), we're proud to
introduce $IBCX ‚Äî the first fully-collateralized index token for the Cosmos.

I made various dashboard apps for some protocols/wallets part-time and was
soon disappointed that they were moving cringely outside their ecosystem.

It turns out that services are primarily associated with specific Layer-1
chains built by the same team or shared VCs. Users need multi-chain and
scalability, but products were just too busy looking at other business
things. The others are closed-source software, so development is centralized
to the team. If you want your protocol listed, you have to depend on the
team to add support.

That made me decide to build an open-source dashboard of my own. And after
that, I began building, made the team, and named the app "Bento." You can
