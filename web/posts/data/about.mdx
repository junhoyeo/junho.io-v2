## IBCX

<Position>Product Manager/Frontend Developer 2022.10 ~</Position>

The [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network) ecosystem was founded on the belief that the future of blockchain lies in specialized chains for specific applications,
and this vision has already come to fruition with the successful deployment of numerous AppChains serving millions of users.

Until now, people who believed in Cosmos bought \$ATOM, but it lacked direct representation of the potential of other projects being built.
That is why we created **\$IBCX, the Interchain Basket of Coins**.

As the first fully-collateralized index token for Cosmos, \$IBCX reflects the overall growth rate of the entire ecosystem,
effectively making investments for Cosmonauts.
**Governed by the [ION DAO](https://ion.wtf), \$IBCX is a secure and easily deployable asset comprising a basket of leading Cosmos coins weighted by market capitalization.**

You can learn more about $IBCX and the ION DAO at [index.ion.wtf](https://index.ion.wtf).

## Bento

<Position>Founder ~</Position>

<Image alt="" src="/assets/about/bento.png" />

I developed dashboard apps for protocols and wallets on a part-time basis, but I quickly became disappointed with their limitations.

Many services were closely tied to a specific layer-1 chain, as they were either built by the same team or funded by the same venture capital firms.
This often resulted in these **products struggling to expand beyond their own ecosystem**
and not being able to meet the needs of users who required multi-chain functionality and scalability.

In addition, many of these products were closed-source software,
which centralized development and required users to rely on the team to add support for their desired protocols.

Dissatisfied with the available dashboard options, I decided to create my own open-source dashboard.
I began building the app and assembled a team to work on it, named the resulting product **"Bento."**
You can learn more about Bento and try it out for yourself at [bento.finance](https://www.bento.finance).

## ZEP Studio

<Position>Led Development for Hackathon</Position>

<Image alt="" src="/assets/about/zep-studio.png" />

ZEP is a platform that allows creators to build interactive and productivity apps using its SDK, ZEP Script.
However, creating apps with it can be challenging for those without prior development knowledge, and the testing process can be inefficient.

That's where our block coding editor comes in.
**[ZEP Studio](https://www.behance.net/gallery/150851977/ZEP-STUDIO-Block-Coding-Editor)** simplifies the process of creating ZEP Script-based apps and offers three key advantages - no code or developers required,
fast testing and easy deployment, and efficient previews - making it easy for anyone to create their own virtual world.

ZEP Studio uses [Google's Blockly](https://github.com/google/blockly) as its back-end, **while improving the user experience with a block-coding editor interface similar to Scratch.**
Whether you're a seasoned developer or a complete beginner, it has everything you need to create amazing apps on the ZEP platform.
