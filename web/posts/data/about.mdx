## Threads API

- Built the world's first unofficial Threads API through reverse engineering 12 hours after launch
- Hit 1,500+ GitHub stars before Meta asked me to stop by sending me [a cease and desist letter](https://github.com/junhoyeo/threads-api)

## Aleph

<Position>Co-Founder and CTO 2023.02 - 2025</Position>

- Company building decentralized stablecoin, raised >1M.
- Experienced significant deficiencies with co-founder in financial management/communication issues with investors, while experiencing multiple strategic pivots, which led to wind down the company.

- Some of the ideas we explored was:
  - Multi-currency stablecoin
    - with own monetary policy
    - backed by BTC
    - earned initial traction by accelerating the community burn of USTC (which turned out to be a mistake).
  - A blockchain eliminating state bloats by making each application runs in its own "container"
    - which is an application-specific lightweight ledger, sequencer, and execution environment
      - that only commits STARK proof of execution to the Parent Security Provider (L1)
      - and state references/UTXO history to Storage Provider (another component that's periphery to the L1).
    - users only sync data for applications they're currently using.

- Lessons learned:

## IBCX

<Position>Product Manager/Frontend Developer 2022.10 - 2023.02</Position>

The [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network) ecosystem was founded on the belief that the future of blockchain lies in specialized chains for specific applications,
and this vision has already come to fruition with the successful deployment of numerous AppChains serving millions of users.

Until now, people who believed in Cosmos bought \$ATOM, but it lacked direct representation of the potential of other projects being built.
That is why we created **\$IBCX, the Interchain Basket of Coins**.

As the first fully-collateralized index token for Cosmos, \$IBCX reflects the overall growth rate of the entire ecosystem,
effectively making investments for Cosmonauts.
**Governed by the [ION DAO](https://ion.wtf), \$IBCX is a secure and easily deployable asset comprising a basket of leading Cosmos coins weighted by market capitalization.**

You can learn more about $IBCX and the ION DAO at [index.ion.wtf](https://index.ion.wtf).

## Twitter

Elon hired [George Hotz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hotz) to fix Twitter search, and he opened a competition for open-source developers/designers to implement the new search feature without private code access. I submitted my solution and received a mention.

## Bento

<Position>Founder</Position>

<Image alt="" src="/assets/about/bento.png" />

I developed dashboard apps for protocols and wallets on a part-time basis, but I quickly became disappointed with their limitations.

Many services were closely tied to a specific layer-1 chain, as they were either built by the same team or funded by the same venture capital firms.
This often resulted in these **products struggling to expand beyond their own ecosystem**
and not being able to meet the needs of users who required multi-chain functionality and scalability.

In addition, many of these products were closed-source software,
which centralized development and required users to rely on the team to add support for their desired protocols.

Dissatisfied with the available dashboard options, I decided to create my own open-source dashboard.
I began building the app and assembled a team to work on it, named the resulting product **"Bento."**
You can learn more about Bento and try it out for yourself at [bento.finance](https://www.bento.finance).

## ZEP Studio

<Position>Led Development for Hackathon</Position>

> This is a hackathon project!

<Image alt="" src="/assets/about/zep-studio.png" />

ZEP is a platform that allows creators to build interactive and productivity apps using its SDK, ZEP Script.
However, creating apps with it can be challenging for those without prior development knowledge, and the testing process can be inefficient.

That's where our block coding editor comes in.
**[ZEP Studio](https://www.behance.net/gallery/150851977/ZEP-STUDIO-Block-Coding-Editor)** simplifies the process of creating ZEP Script-based apps and offers three key advantages - no code or developers required,
fast testing and easy deployment, and efficient previews - making it easy for anyone to create their own virtual world.

ZEP Studio uses [Google's Blockly](https://github.com/google/blockly) as its back-end, **while improving the user experience with a block-coding editor interface similar to Scratch.**
Whether you're a seasoned developer or a complete beginner, it has everything you need to create amazing apps on the ZEP platform.

## Pylon Protocol

I contributed to the product side of various DeFi protocols, working part-time on their design and frontend development.
**Pylon Protocol**, an protocol that powers DeFi savings and payment services on [Terra](<https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_(blockchain)>) using yield redirection, was among the protocols I worked on.

I built the frontend of Pylon Gateway, a project crowdfunding and token launch platform that allowed users to invest via deposits.
**Pylon maintained an average TVL of $330M** before the [UST depeg incident](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_bubble#Collapse_of_Terra-Luna) and was later acquired.
